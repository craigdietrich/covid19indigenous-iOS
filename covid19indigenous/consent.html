      <h6>Greetings</h6>
           <p>We are seeking your consent to use this App. Completing a survey on the App indicates that you have understood that you are voluntarily participating in this work. Thank you for taking time to consider your involvement as a participant.</p>

           <h6>Background</h6>
           <p>This digital health initiative is part of our larger project on Indigenous-led responses to COVID-19. The project is called Kitatipithitamak Mithwayawin, which is Cree for community control or self- determination over health. It is led by researchers from the University of Manitoba and University College of the North. And it is shaped by 11 First Nations partner organizations in Manitoba and Ontario. You can find out more about this initiative and our other activities on our project website at <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://ourdataindigenous.ca')">ourdataindigenous.ca</a> and on our Facebook site at <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous/')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a>.</p>
            
           <h6>Project Goals</h6>
            <p>The overall goal of this project is to provide information and resources that can help support Indigenous communities and organizations during the COVID-19 pandemic and into the future. The use of the App will ideally help communities and organizations address barriers to data and research that have been made worse during the pandemic. But the use of the App will also help these communities and organizations achieve control over data and research moving forward. The leadership in each community or organization will decide the focus of the data collection so that it best addresses local needs and priorities. The data that are generated through the App will be under the control of the leadership of that particular community or organization. To be clear, the university researchers behind this App are not interested in the data and will only have access to the data if our help is requested by each community or organization. Our own research interest focuses on evaluating the success and limitations of the App in supporting communities and in achieving data sovereignty. This would be achieved by follow-up interviews that are separate from the App itself.</p>

           <h6>Possible Risks</h6>
            <p>Very few if any risks are involved in participating. This initiative that created the App has been approved by our Indigenous Advisory Board and by the University of Manitoba Ethics Board. It is up to the communities that administer each individual survey to what extent data will be shared amongst or outside of a community; refer to the informed consent inside of the survey itself, if one exists, for more information about sharing protocols..Some surveys might include sensitive or triggering information, questions, or possible answers.</p>
            
            <p>The survey is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We will not be providing participant codes to users under 18.</p>

           <h6>Possible Benefits</h6>
           <p>Many benefits will arise from this project. Most communities and organizations are struggling to access data. When any information is made available by the government, it is usually delayed and incomplete. The information collected here will help address these barriers. You can use this App to share your concerns and hopes to your leadership directly in your own words. The data generated through this App are culturally appropriate and speak to your needs and the needs of your community and/or organization as a whole. Communities will collect information on topics that they see as important. The questionnaires can be modified by community leaders, researchers and/or Health Directors to reflect local needs and priorities. This will help ensure that the information that is collected is relevant.</p>

           <p>Indigenous communities across Canada and indeed from anywhere in the world are welcome to participate in this project. This will be the first time anywhere in the world that mobile apps have been used to assess local priorities by Indigenous communities in ways that they control from beginning to end. There is growing interest in the use of this App across the country and by November 2021 the App was being adopted by over 15 communities.</p>

           <h6>Details of survey</h6>
           
           <p>A local researcher can be hired in each community or organization to help participants with the technology and with the questionnaire. This will help ensure that things run smoothly. Researchers on this project will provide a summary report to all participants and the local leadership. We can help with this data analysis and report writing if requested. We will also provide updates and other relevant content through the mobile App if this is desired. And leadership and the Health Directors can use the App to communicate with participants.</p>

           <h6>Possible concerns and withdrawal from project</h6>
            <p>If you do not want to proceed, please refrain from filling out the survey. In the event that you have completed the survey and it hasn't yet been uploaded to the server, you can delete all app data using the button at the bottom of the About Survey page. You also have the right to withdraw from the project at any time. Please use the contact information listed below to request withdrawal. All of your data would of course then be deleted from the project.</p>

            <p>If you have any questions about this digital project, or if you want to withdraw from the project once you have submitted data, please contact Steph McLachlan at steph.mclachlan@umanitoba.ca or Kimberley Wilde by phone at 204.474-9316 or by email at Kimberley.Wilde@umanitoba.ca.</p>

           <p>As indicated above, the Joint-Faculty Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba has approved this project. If you have any concerns or complaints about what we are doing, please contact Kimberly or the Human Ethics Coordinator by phone (204.474.7122) or by email  at humanethics@umanitoba.ca.</p>

           <p>Thank you for reading through this information. We look forward to working with you and learning from you into the future.</p>

            <p>Steph and Kimberley</p>
