      <p>Greetings,</p>
      <p>We are seeking your consent to take part in this project. Completing this survey on the mobile
      app indicates that you have understood that you are voluntarily participating in this work.
      Thank you for taking time to consider your involvement as a participant. This digital health
      initiative is part of our larger project on Indigenous-led responses to COVID-19. It is called
      Kitatipithitamak Mithwayawan, which is Cree for community control or self- determination over
      health. It is led by researchers from the University of Manitoba and University College of the
      North. And it is shaped by 11 First Nations partner organizations in Manitoba and Ontario. You
      can find out more about this initiative and our other activities on our project website at
      <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://covid19indigenous.ca/digital-health-initiative/')">covid19indigenous.ca/digital-health-initiative</a> and on our Facebook site at
      <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous/')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a>.</p>
      <p>We are interested in how you are doing in the face of the pandemic. We are also interested in any
      impacts on your health and wellbeing. And we are interested in what you and your community
      are doing to stay healthy. Our goal is to provide information that can help local Health Directors
      and leadership respond to the needs of their communities. We will also evaluate how effective
      these apps are facilitating the control that communities have over their health and wellbeing as
      they respond to COVID-19.</p>
      <p>The data shared by participants in your community will belong to and be controlled by your
      Health Director. No one else will have access to these data without their permission. Complete
      control over this information by communities is sometimes referred to as data sovereignty or
      OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession). Summaries of this information will also be
      made available to all participants. Your Health Directors will also be able to compare the results
      from your community with those of other participating communities and to share ideas for
      responding to COVID-19 if they choose to do so.</p>
      <p>In total, we anticipate that 70-100 members of your community will participate in this initiative.
      And, in total, about 25 First Nations communities across Canada will participate. We have hired
      a local community researcher to help you with the survey and to make sure that the mobile apps
      work properly. This will be the first time anywhere in the world that mobile apps have been used
      to monitor health by Indigenous communities.</p>
      <p>This first survey is a long-version that provides background information too and will take about
      40 minutes to complete. Every two weeks, we will also do a quick check-in to see what if
      anything has changed since the last time you completed the survey. This much shorter check-in
      survey will take about 5 minutes to complete. Researchers on this project will provide a
      summary report to all participants and the Health Director every two weeks. We will also provide
      updates and other relevant content through the mobile app.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions about this digital project, please contact Steph McLachlan
      ( steph.mclachlan@umanitoba.ca) or Hannah Muhajarine by phone at (204.474-9316) or by email
      (hannah@covid19Indigenous.ca).</p>
      <p>The Joint-Faculty Research Ethics Board at the University of Manitoba has approved this
      project. If you have any concerns or complaints about what we are doing, please contact Hannah
      or the Human Ethics Coordinator by phone (204.474.7122) or by email
      (humanethics@umanitoba.ca).</p>
      <p>Thank you for reading through this information. We look forward to working with you and
      learning from you.</p>
      <p>Steph, Myrle, Evan, and Hannah</p>
