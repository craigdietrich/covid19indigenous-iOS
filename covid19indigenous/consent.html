      <h6>Greetings</h6>
     <p>We are seeking your consent to take part in this project. Completing this survey on the mobile app indicates that you have understood that you are voluntarily participating in this work. Thank you for taking time to consider your involvement as a participant.</p>

     <h6>Background</h6>
     <p>This digital health initiative is part of our larger project on Indigenous-led responses to COVID-19. It is called Kitatipithitamak Mithwayawin, which is Cree for community control or self- determination over health. It is led by researchers from the University of Manitoba and University College of the North. And it is shaped by 11 First Nations partner organizations in Manitoba and Ontario. You can find out more about this initiative and our other activities on our project website at <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://covid19indigenous.ca/digital-health-initiative/')">covid19indigenous.ca/digital-health-initiative</a> and on our Facebook site at <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous/')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a>.</p>
      
     <h6>Project Goals</h6>
      <p>Our overall goal is to provide information that can help local Health Directors and leadership respond to the needs of their communities. Part of that is to see how you and other members of your communities are doing in the face of the pandemic. This will involve tracking how your wellbeing and the wellbeing of your community change over time. And then identifying what you and your community are doing to stay healthy. This information will be made available to Health Directors in real-time so they can make use of this information in everyday decision-making.</p>

     <h6>Possible Risks</h6>
      <p>Very few if any risks are involved in participating. This initiative has been approved by our Indigenous Advisory Board and by the University of Manitoba Ethics Board. The information being collected is health-related and so is potentially sensitive. However, the data are anonymous and so no one will know your identity. The data shared by participants in your community will belong only to your community. They will be controlled by your Health Director. No one else will have access to these data without their permission. Complete control over this information by communities is sometimes referred to as data sovereignty or OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, and Possession). Your Health Directors will also be able to compare the results from your community with those of other participating communities and to share ideas for responding to COVID-19 if they choose to do so.</p>
      
      <p>The survey is not intended for individuals under the age of 18. We will not be providing participant codes to users under 18.</p>

     <h6>Possible Benefits</h6>
     <p>Many benefits will arise from this project. Most communities are struggling to access health data. When any information is made available by the government, it is usually delayed and incomplete. The information collected here will help address these gaps. You can use this app to share your concerns and hopes to your leadership directly in your own words. Our approach is holistic in nature as it includes physical, psychological, emotional, cultural, spiritual and environmental dimensions of wellbeing. So it is culturally appropriate and speaks to your needs and the needs of the communities as a whole. Communities will collecting information on topics that they see as important. The questionnaires can be modified by Health Directors to reflect local needs and priorities. This will help ensure that the information that is collected is relevant In total, we anticipate that 70-100 members of your community will participate in this initiative, which will give a good sense of the health and wellbeing of your community as a whole.</p>

     <p>In total, about 30 Indigenous communities across Canada will participate. This will be the first time anywhere in the world that mobile apps have been used to monitor health by Indigenous communities. That so many communities are participating will also give a good sense of how Indigenous people as a whole are responding to the pandemic. And it highlight all the positive things communities are doing to cartake their wellbeing.</p>

     <h6>Details of survey</h6>
     <p> The project will continue for a year at most.This first survey is a long-version that provides background information too and will take about 40 minutes to complete. Every two weeks, we will also do a quick check-in to see what if anything has changed since the last time you completed the survey. This much shorter check-in survey will take about 5 minutes to complete. .</p>

     <p>A local researcher will be hired in each community to help Health Directors and the participants with the technology and with the questionnaire. This will help ensure that things run smoothly. Researchers on this project will provide a summary report to all participants and the Health Director every two weeks. We will also provide updates and other relevant content through the mobile app. And leadership and the Health Directors can use the apps to communicate with participants.</p>
