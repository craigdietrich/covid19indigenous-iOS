    <p>This mobile app has been designed to support Indigenous communities by
    helping local Health Directors to collect meaningful data related to COVID-19. This information will be of great use to Health Centres and leadership as they track and monitor
    how community members are doing and responding to COVID-19. They may also
    choose to compare their own outcomes with those of other communities
    if they decide to do so.  Each community will have complete control over their own data, and who they might share this information with, if they do so at all.</p>
    <p>Two forms of the questionnaire contained within the mobile app exist. Health Directors will be able to add or eliminate questions so the survey better reflects the priorities of each community. A longer (baseline) version will be filled out by all participants the first time they complete the survey. This will take about 30-40 minutes to complete. A shorter version of the questionnaire will be completed every two weeks thereafter. This will enable Health Directors to easily check in and monitor how participants in their community are doing. This version will take about 5 minutes to complete.</p>
    <p>The questions focus on impacts from COVID-19, but they also highlight
    the many proactive and positive actions taken by communities to ensure their health
    and wellbeing. Participants will have the option to share their insights and experiences in their own words using video, audio and in writing. These responses will add to and complement scaled and ranking questions that are quantitative in nature.</p>
    <p>The mobile app is available for free download by everyone who wants to and has much cultural and health content that will be of general interest. But only
    members of participating communities who are given unique entry codes
    by local Health Directors will be able to access the questionnaires. The
    mobile and web apps have been developed as part of our larger Indigenous-led
    project on COVID-19, kitatipithitamak mithwayawin, which is Cree for
    control or sovereignty over health.</p>
