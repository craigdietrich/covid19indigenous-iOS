    <p>This mobile App (Our Data Indigenous) can be used to deliver any questionnaire that is of interest to a host community or organization. The App can be used with or without our technical support. The questionnaire that was originally housed in the App focused on COVID-19. It is still available for use if communities choose to do so. Some of the questions in this Covid questionnaire are open-ended and enable participants to respond in their own words. </p>
       <p>Although the Covid questionnaire is still available for use if it is of interest to communities, the App is designed to be used for any purpose or topic.
   Communities can use some or all of the original questions on Covid. Or they can come up with their own questions. Or they can maybe ask us to help them develop new questions. Any such changes are made using the web App which runs on a computer. Once the questionnaire is ready to go on the web app, it is automatically loaded onto the mobile App. Once participants complete their questionnaires, then local leadership can immediately look at the data. This is done through the web dashboard using “data visualization” tools that show patterns or trends in the data. Or if communities or organizations are interested in our help, they can reach out to us. And we can help prepare the data. While keeping everything in confidence of course.</p>
       <p>The App is available for free download by everyone who wants to and has much cultural and health content that will be of general interest. But unique codes are needed to access the questionnaire. We provide these codes to participating communities. But this does not give us access to the data. We would only do so if given permission by each community. The data collected by a community belong to that same community. No one else or no other community has access to these data </p>
