    <p>Our project initially arose to help support Indigenous communities as they faced COVID-19. This App became an important part of this support. But we soon realized that this App could be used for any and everything related to data. It is definitely not limited to the pandemic or even health and wellbeing. As university researchers we donâ€™t have ties to industry. And so are free to support Indigenous communities and organizations in any way that seems useful. Our salaries are already paid by the government and our universities. So we can provide this support at very little cost or at no cost to communities  The website for this digital initiative is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://ourdataindigenous.ca');">ourdataindigenous.ca</a>. These mobile and web apps are part of a larger project entitled kitatipithitamak mithwayawin, Cree for sovereignty over health. Our project Facebook page is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous/');">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a>. Based at the University of Manitoba, we represent a diverse team of Indigenous Scholars, Allied Researchers, Elders and Health Knowledge Keepers, Community Health Directors, Regional Tribal Councils and Health Authorities from Manitoba and Ontario in Canada. Our project is guided by an Advisory Council consisting of First Nations communities and organizations that oversees our project activities.</p>
