    <p>This mobile App (Our Data Indigenous) can be used to deliver any questionnaire that is of interest to a host community or organization. The App can be used with or without our technical support. The App is designed to be used for any purpose or topic.
   Surveys are created using an online dashboard which runs on a computer. Once the questionnaire has been created on the dashboard, it can be loaded onto the mobile App using unique passcodes that are specific to your survey or even to the individual people you want to invite to take the survey. Once participants complete their questionnaires, then local leadership can immediately look at the data. This is done through the web dashboard using “data visualization” tools that show patterns or trends in the data. Or if communities or organizations are interested in our help, they can reach out to us. And we can help prepare the data while keeping everything in confidence.</p>
       <p>The App is available for free download by everyone. But unique passcodes are needed to access questionnaires. The data collected by a community using these unique passcodes belong to that same community. No one else or no other community has access to these data </p>
