    <h6>What</h6>
        <p>The Our Data Indigenous Project is grounded in the principles of data sovereignty. This is a concept that recognizes the right of Indigenous communities and organizations to control and own their own data. But in practice, this is often very difficult to achieve. Especially if the funding and tools for collecting data are controlled by outsiders. We have developed a mobile application (App) titled, "Our Data Indigenous" that addresses these problems.</p>
        <p>The Our Indigenous App allows communities to create and administer surveys. Surveys can be useful to plan and evaluate programming, track community health and wellness, write funding proposals and reports for funders and the government, collect environmental monitoring information, and create maps. Your projects might focus on economics, the environment, health and wellbeing, housing, culture and language, etc... These data can also be used to inform your own future proposal writing. You are only limited by your priorities and your imagination. You will have full control and ownership over any data that are collected. And there are absolutely no strings or costs attached. </p>
        <h6>Why</h6>
        <p>Indigenous communities need to be able to generate data and have full control over those data. This is especially true in times of widespread crisis when powerful interests in society like governments and industry decide to restrict access to data. This App enables communities and organizations to sidestep these barriers. </p>
        <h6>Who</h6>
        <p>We are a group of Indigenous and allied researchers based at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada and Occidental College in Los Angeles, USA. This App was developed as part of our kitatipithitamak mithwayawin project. This is Cree for sovereignty over health.  We have an Advisory Council made up of Health Directors, Tribal Councils and Health Authorities from Manitoba and Ontario. Our project Facebook page is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a> and our website is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://ourdataindigenous.ca')">ourdataindigenous.ca</a>.</p>
        <h6>Where</h6>
        <p>All Indigenous communities across Canada and for that matter around the world are welcome to use the App.</p>
        <h6>When</h6>
        <p>The App launched in February 2021. It is now available to download for free on Google Play and the Apple Store.</p>
        <h6>How</h6>
       <p>We can help get you set up with the App, help you develop questionnaires on topics that are important to you, and help you analyze survey results. However, all the data collected with the app belong to you and nobody will ever have access to your data without your permission.</p>
