    <h6>What</h6>
    <p>We have developed web and mobile apps that will help communities document the impacts of and
    their responses to COVID-19 in real time. Communities will have full control over their own data, and
    only share this information with others if they want.</p>   
    <h6>Why</h6>
    <p>First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit communities face barriers when accessing health data. This project will
    enable them to collect their own data and to respond to any impacts, reducing reliance on outside
    governments. The project will also help communities to track any changes in wellbeing.</p>
    <h6>Who</h6>
    <p>Our project is titled kitatipithitamak mithwayawin, Cree for sovereignty over health. Based at the
    University of Manitoba, we have an Advisory Council made up of Health Directors, Tribal Councils and
    Health Authorities from Manitoba and Ontario. Our project Facebook page is
    <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a> and
    our website is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://covid19indigenous.ca')">covid19indigenous.ca</a>.</p>
    <h6>Where</h6>
    <p>To begin, we are reaching out to Indigenous communities in Western and Northern Canada. We strive to have up to
    30 Indigenous communities to participate initially but we welcome and encourage the involvement of all Indigenous
    communities to join us in this initiative.</p>
    <h6>When</h6>
    <p>We are currently preparing to soft launch the app with a group of communities as we wait for the android
    version to be approved. We will do the full launch in February 2021 at which point communities across Canada
    (and the globe) will be welcome to participate.</p>
    <h6>How</h6>
    <p>We will hire local researchers in each community to help out. Local Health Directors can modify
    questionnaires to fit the needs of their communities. Health Directors can immediately look at the
    results or get us to provide regular summaries.</p>
