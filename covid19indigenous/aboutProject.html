    <h6>What</h6>
        <p>Indigenous communities and organizations are often frustrated by research projects, particularly ones that fail to reflect their own priorities and that they have little control over. At their worst, such projects can create much harm. Our project is grounded in the principles of data sovereignty. This is a concept that recognizes the right of Indigenous communities and organizations to control and own their own data. But in practice, this is often really very difficult to achieve. Especially if the funding and tools for collecting data are controlled by outsiders. We have developed a mobile application (App) titled, "Our Data Indigenous" that addresses these problems.</p>
        <p>The App is very easy and intuitive to use. And it can be used to collect data with surveys. Surveys can be useful to plan and evaluate programming, track community health and wellness, and write funding proposals and reports for funders and the government. Your projects might focus on economics, the environment, health and wellbeing, housing, culture and language, etc... These data can also be used to inform your own future proposal writing. You are only limited by your priorities and your imagination. You will have full control and ownership over any data that are collected. And there are absolutely no strings or costs attached. </p>
        <h6>Why</h6>
        <p>Indigenous communities need to be able to generate data and have full control over those data. Current and earlier pandemics have shown that Indigenous communities and organizations still have little access to data. This is especially true in times of widespread crisis when powerful interests in society like governments and industry decide to restrict access to data. This App enables communities and organizations to sidestep these barriers. </p>
        <h6>Who</h6>
        <p>We are a group of Indigenous and allied researchers based at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg, Canada and Occidental College in Los Angeles, USA. This App was developed as part of our kitatipithitamak mithwayawin project. This is Cree for sovereignty over health.  We have an Advisory Council made up of Health Directors, Tribal Councils and Health Authorities from Manitoba and Ontario. Our project Facebook page is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a> and our website is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://ourdataindigenous.ca')">ourdataindigenous.ca</a>.</p>
        <h6>Where</h6>
        <p>All Indigenous communities across Canada and for that matter around the world are welcome to use the App. Over the next year, we have some funding in place to help support communities. But the App is so easy to use that no funding support is really needed .</p>
        <h6>When</h6>
        <p>The App launched in February 2021. It is now available to download for free on Google Play and the Apple Store.</p>
        <h6>How</h6>
       <p>These funds can be used to hire local researchers in each community to help out. They can help develop questionnaires that form the basis of the App. Funds can also be used to identify participants and to give honouraria to participants. The funds can even be used to purchase laptops and routers if local connectivity to the Internet is bad. Communities can immediately look at the results as questionnaires are submitted. Or they can get our help making sense of the data if this is useful..</p>
