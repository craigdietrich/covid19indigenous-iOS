    <h6>What</h6>
    <p>We have developed web and mobile apps that will help communities document the impacts of and
    their responses to COVID-19 in real time. Communities will have full control over their own data, and
    only share this information with others if they want.</p>   
    <h6>Why</h6>
    <p>First Nations, MÃ©tis, and Inuit communities face barriers when accessing health data. This project will
    enable them to collect their own data and to respond to any impacts, reducing reliance on outside
    governments. The project will also help communities to track any changes in wellbeing.</p>
    <h6>Who</h6>
    <p>Our project is titled kitatipithitamak mithwayawin, Cree for sovereignty over health. Based at the
    University of Manitoba, we have an Advisory Council made up of Health Directors, Tribal Councils and
    Health Authorities from Manitoba and Ontario. Our project Facebook page is
    <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://www.facebook.com/covid19indigenous')">facebook.com/covid19indigenous</a> and
    our website is <a href="javascript:doButtonClick('https://covid19indigenous.ca')">covid19indigenous.ca</a>.</p>
    <h6>Where</h6>
    <p>To begin, we are reaching out to First Nations communities in Ontario, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and
    Manitoba. In total we hope that at least 24 communities will participate. That said, we welcome and
    encourage any and all Indigenous communities to join us, no matter where they are located.</p>
    <h6>When</h6>
    <p>We are now testing our equipment in a pilot project with four communities in Manitoba. We anticipate
    we will expand our project to all four provinces and beyond starting in October 2020. The monitoring
    will last until at least October 2021.</p>
    <h6>How</h6>
    <p>We will hire local researchers in each community to help out. Local Health Directors can modify
    questionnaires to fit the needs of their communities. Health Directors can immediately look at the
    results or get us to provide regular summaries.</p>
